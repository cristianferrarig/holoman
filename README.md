# Holoman (WIP)

Holoman is a try to integrate Hologram in Middleman but only I get a command line tool and a watcher :D

## Installation

If you're just getting started, install the `middleman` or `middleman-core` gem and generate a new project:

```
gem install middleman
middleman init MY_PROJECT
```

If you already have a Middleman project: Add `gem "holoman", "~> 0.0.2"` to your `Gemfile` and run `bundle install`

## Configuration

```
activate :holoman
```

Sorry, but the extension is not finished yet.

## Command line tool

To init the watcher you need run the start command

```
bundle exec holoman start
```
